Banner Kings is a suite of features developed for Mount & Blade: Bannerlord. The modification focuses on adding depth to gameplay. This is done by expanding and adding layers of complexity to non-combat related features of the game. Inspiration for the mod systems is mostly drawn from games such as Crusader Kings.   

Banner Kings is both a mod and a modding framework - it can be modded by other mods. Such mods can make ample use of its base systems such as Languages, BK Troop Spawn system, Titles, Books, Religions. The best example of an implementation of Banner Kings is [Banner Kings: Cultures Expanded](https://github.com/R-Vaccari/BannerKings.CulturesExpanded), the official lore interpretation and expansion by the BK team.
