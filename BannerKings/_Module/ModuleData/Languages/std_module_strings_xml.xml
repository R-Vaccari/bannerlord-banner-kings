Asera was deified by his deeds and the codes of law which allowed him to establish dominion and settle his people from the Jabal Tamar to the Jabal Ashab. Asera is that which all followers of his Code seek to live up to; though most followers will accept that the words of Asera are transcribed to benefit the bloodlines which followed him. Thus one can only ever seek to live as Asera did, and to know only their success upon arrival in Paradise." />

To make an oath under the auspices of the Slaugh Aos’An is to be bound to the letter or the spirit of one’s words; never more and never both.

Though the attempted Calradification of the Uchalion Plateau could not purge this pagan belief set entirely, it did compartmentalize and mangle its body of rituals. Giants, ghosts, and many an unseen shade were changed from beings of tale and legend to “patient devils” by the whims of the Empire.

    <string id="XyVMjNNp" text="Though there has long been an imperial cult in the Calradic Empire, it grew in popularity in the generations after Darusos’s murder. Emperors were deified, made to stand alongside their own gods as peers. During the waning generations of the united empire many would proclaim themselves god-emperor, or other divinely appointed titles; the rite of the divus can only transubstantiate an emperor upon their death. Thus the last truly ordained imperial cult is that which preaches the words of Arenicos Divus; though upstart branches have begun for an inevitable worship of Ira Divus." />

Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys. He is accompanied by Astaronia, his bride who represents that which must be protected by the machinations of imperial might; and by his daughter Mesnona who was born from the ego of Iovis and who grants insight to mortal petitioners." />

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Though traditionalists will note the Cant is but a deviation of the illuminated manuscripts and oral tales of the pre-Calradic Vlandian culture, modern adherents claim the Cant to be the methodology of rebels, wanderers, rascals, and conquerors. Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller. As such the works depicted therein are often viewed as satire or crude witticisms, but few cloisters will deny their worth.

    <string id="CoLCEywd" text="Founded by the immediate sons of the legendary patriarch of the Southlands, the Code of Asera forms the basis of philosophy, art and law among the members of the confederated Aserai tribes. All tribesmen of the Aserai who do not wander as bedouin, are assumed to be followers of the Code of Asera - though only those who seek to study the intricacies of the mythic patrilineal bloodline and its influence upon the world are celebrated and viewed as Sons of Asera; a facet of colloquial nomenclature meant to force camaraderie as all members of the Sultanate make claim to being descendants of Asera. Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands. As a whole, those who follow the Code of Asera place an emphasis on charity between communities, vengeance against those who defy precedent or tradition, and mercy given in kindness with justice forced if kindness is scorned." />
    <string id="uF2hBKKU" text="Do not be as a glutton or a beast; neither hoarding nor bloodlust should color your life. If you take justice into your hands you may find yourself forever grasping for more - allow your betters to guide you as an elder sibling should; do not kill prisoners who have wronged you without their say. But do not reveal yourself to be lax or limp of arm either; for justice will often be your task." />
    <string id="EFKv7DGi" text="You must never betray the blood of your blood, to do so is to spit upon the Code. If you are called to serve the Aserai, you must shed blood for their cause - at least once, so as to show that you honor your siblings even should you disagree with their choices. You must ensure any who serve you do not suffer the ravages of conflict without justice on your lips and a safe bastion for them to find reprieve in." />
    <string id="bnfbjMGa" text="…A curious question; though I suppose I would know the deeper answers to this. Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders." />
    <string id="hvuqVf2m" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands. Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling." />
    <string id="spy2ujFu" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />
    <string id="itzfxuQ9" text="Be mindful also of the company you keep, for though all among the Aserai are as brothers - and even the Jawwal and Bedouin are as our cousins; those beyond our blood lineage may not understand your purpose. They may lead you from the path, away from the Code; away from the good of the Aserai. But perhaps I speak this in fear - the long toll of the Empire upon our culture." />
    <string id="hmkcSU3i" text="To not seek vengeance against those who have attacked your holdings, besieged your homes, murdered your people - is a greater shame. No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />
    <string id="8b9Qad8j" text="When you are called by your brothers, you must come to them; you must serve beside them, you must never fail them if it is in your power. Know also that keeping the company of those outside the Code of Asera will surely corrupt you - you are your brother’s keeper, and they in turn yours. For good or for ill." />
    <string id="NiDTPPz2" text="Know that I tolerate your presence on behalf of my blooded siblings in the Banu, and though you may desire to coax me with honeyed words or threats of coercion - know also that I am beyond your grasp.

Speak truthfully and with no deceit, lest I denounce your lineage and see them flayed to the last." />
    <string id="gw31Xmny" text="Peace be upon you, outlander. May you walk with the safety of Asera while you dwell in the company of his sons - and while you walk the lands where his Code is law.

    <string id="fvJt4aTX" text="Peace be to you, outlander. You do not carry yourself as a Son of Asera, so I shall forgive your ignorance - provided you come here in search of wisdom.

    <string id="ws5gbCMX" text="Mashaera, blood of my blood.

    <string id="yMvqUQpw" text="Peace be upon you, my kin. Have you come to study the Code of Asera?

    <string id="QqhAVhTr" text="Peace be upon you and may you be favored by Asera, my kin. What may this humble faqir do for you on this glorious day?" />
    <string id="byHGTYHh" text="Alas, you are no Son of Asera and thus you could never truly follow the Code of Asera. Not in any way that I could fathom. There may be precedent for one beyond our blood to successfully follow the code, but for this you should seek out an Akhund; a scholar of the faith." />
    <string id="A06Nfw6t" text="You think that it would go unnoticed how the folk here cringe at your visage? How your name is whispered with scornful lips? Are they mislead about you? Perhaps, perhaps. We shall see." />
    <string id="CfdXEpue" text="You are known to me and to this village; not as a savior or as a good soul, but as one of us. You are humble, perhaps because you lack the boldness to pursue being charitable - or perhaps just the means. I do not know, and I do not judge." />

    <string id="ZPEn4EDa" text="If you wish to be made a follower of the Code of Asera, you must treat these people as you would a sibling - you must cherish them, exalt them, protect them and educate them. Show them your better nature and I shall perform upon you our rites of induction." />

    <string id="uz70E5mx" text="I offer my sage counsel to the kin of the Banu, to guide them upon the paths walked by Asera of old. I grant them the means of pilgrimage - for only when one knows the deepest wisdom and learned truths of the Code of Asera may they truly strive for self-improvement." />
    <string id="EofwaHJQ" text="I preach the glory of Asera, our progenitor of legend. I preach lessons learned from the treasury of wisdom he has granted us as his children. I preach that the Aserai shall reign in happiness and in sorrow, so long as we remain as brothers within the Banu confederacies." />
    <string id="3sxQsTy7" text="I preach that which is hidden in poetics of Nahasi dialects and in the riddles of converts stolen away by Darshi slavers in generations past.

    <string id="cDU19QLK" text="I preach the Code of Asera, the backbone of our society, the soul of our nation. For we are all Sons of Asera in these lands, and it is through the patriarch’s example that we go forth in honor and bring glory to his legacy." />
    <string id="QfQjwGLe" text="I ensure they remember that they are as siblings to the lowliest beggar or the most jackal-thirsting Jawwal marauder; that they must always express love towards that which is good and revile the roguery that leads the soul towards wicked deeds." />

    <string id="EYkmpAva" text="I preach that we should question the nature of goodness and of wisdom; for a good man would not claim to be wise, and a wise man not claim to be good." />

    <string id="gToavgYL" text="A common question among the devout and misguided alike; for how can one truly be assured they walk the righteous path? We know not until the end comes and we are weighed against the deeds of our progenitor; but I shall guide you with what wisdom I can." />
    <string id="DXwkpjeQ" text="Consider your actions and why it is you perform them. If you are of influence, do you wield this power for the good of your siblings or do you take it for your own aggrandizement? When your people starve, do you feast? Do you turn to the sword? Is blood spilled for bread gained a worthy trade?" />
    <string id="u0iwuK22" text="It does my heart kindly to hear you wish to prove your faith. We live in an age of lip service by most - though I hold no blame to the common man for this; they show their adherence and their faith in their daily labors.

    <string id="duyNvFEg" text="Seek to improve the lives of even the least of your people and you shall make kings of them all; and know that should you find yourself poorer and your servants richer that you are a better sibling than many of your blood.

    <string id="4zEWWVpe" text="Foremost in my viewing, as a man of the cities of our lands; is the act of almsgiving.

    <string id="kM7O8NK3" text="If you seek to prove your faith, you must internalize the Code of Asera - you must learn and accept that you are but one of his Sons - and you must seek to bring forth a better world for your children to inherit.

Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />

But to answer your question, and to say it right, I’ll say just this: I am that which judges a true Battanian of their worth.To see that they make mischief and might alike enough to please their grandfather’s grandfathers in the heavenly hereafter.Ne’er are there more an Uchalion born Battanian than those who follow the creed of the Amra Ollamh." />

    <string id="NhdiHm3M" text="Though the Calradic Empire had long possessed an imperial cult to venerate Emperors who were deemed to be “deliverers” and “saviors” of the civilized world, during the latter years prior to the schism and inerrenegrum the practice of viewing all emperors as god-emperors had become vulgorously commonplace. It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos. Lay flamines, their purer superiors of the Flamines Castus, and the figurehead of the Rex Sacrarum of Lycaron, collect alms and absolve the sins of petty mortal ambition to those who seek to walk the path of the Martyr." />
    <string id="7qeT1yJm" text="I’ve no qualms over many a mortal failing, but if you are to bind thine self to the throne of the Martyr and seek to untwist your soul of sin - you must serve none save for another Darusosian Martyr. Be it Rhagaea Pethros, the Divine Heir Ira Pethros; or any other who may yet emerge immaculate - you must serve only the ends of our Empire. Seek not to burden thyself with a hoard of filthy lucre, for denars shall twist thine soul to marred, mangled ends." />
    <string id="VW8kECbX" text="Be not one who acts unbenignantly, for we servants within the Darusosian Martyrdom need be graceful in our deeds. Do not sully your house with cohorts or spouses who were born of upstart states or pagan cultures who deny the will of the Martyr." />
    <string id="kh0srVMy" text="Only a blind man would look upon the state of the Empire and think it saved. If you wish to remain in the good graces of the Darusosian Martyrdom, you should not seek to usurp the whims of the imperial throne. Should you be blessed to serve the house of Pethros, allow them to grant you territories - never make demands of them. If you fail to provide donations and services to our clergy, this too shall be noticed and your reputation shall fall." />
    <string id="99QxoVg0" text="Give generously to the Martyrdom, for to do otherwise is to see patrician and plebeian alike suffer unjustly.

If you are friend, I bid you allow me offer you succor and comfort; if you are yet to accept the Martyr into your heart, pray allow me to elucidate.You shall know no regret save for time spent in ignorance of a beatific truth." />
    <string id="QhEHgXaL" text="Mine is the voice that speaks for the Martyr’s will, alas only in mournful penitentials.

Seldom am I to preach, for mine is the role to contemplate the mysteries of creation as glanced by Darusos as he was made eternal through the rites of divus.Fret not, for though I hold all the myriad gods of our Empire - both those liberated from savage cultures and those brought with us from our ancestral birthplace - I am that which holds the Martyr above all others." />
    <string id="oZddNoSP" text="I preach the doctrines of Darusos, our Emperor betrayed in his youth by the vile treachery of his generals. A child, wise beyond his years and graced with the beatific sight of Heaven; he sought to see the Empire reign as a place of order where patrician and plebeian alike need not suffer fear. He would see us fed, watered, and granted the joys that we are due - and if not for the craven workings of sellswords and tyrant upstarts, he would have reigned one thousand years." />
    <string id="fPT4Barn" text="Lo, for I preach the tragedy of the Martyr Darusos, an Emperor betrayed in his youth by the cruel ambitions of his generals. He was targeted, for even the most oathbound man can be made a craven sellsword when they gaze upon the throne of an Empire. Darusos was a goodly sort, he wept for the Palaics and the Vakken, he wrote an elegy for the Perassic League in their fading days. He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men. It was for this that Darusos was crucified upon a sacred fig tree and set ablaze - all his aspirations but kindling… Take heart, for this is the sermon of a Martyr - not merely one of a man." />
    <string id="dh0cpao4" text="‘Tis my desire to spread the denied transpositions of the Martyr to the licentious masses of our age. To absolve our Empire the foul stains of hubristic usurpers, and to see seized with thine own hands a fate where the line betwixt Darusos to Arenicos, and beyond to Rhagaea Pethros and Ira Pethros may undergo the rite of divus before tragedy may befall them. I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />
    <string id="EkCUxcN4" text="But no. Betrayed by his generals, spat upon by the Senate, and mocked by his honor guard - Darusos was crucified to a sacred fig tree and burnt to cinders. His great works and scribed doctrines set ablaze with him. As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
    <string id="b9bfZtiZ" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />
    <string id="xcCHnLYz" text="Ahh, ‘tis wisdom and arrogance that thou shalt seek the Rex Sacrarum for elucidation. What is thine intent, to seek one wise beyond the ken of an age and bid they preach the rote doctrine of the lay flamines? Thoust have no need to be coy, nor ignorant, nor false. I shall speak and do so with courtesy - for this is what the Martyr would have of me. Perilous is the hour and heretics run rife through our Empire.Scourge those who cling to the Augeo Sophica or the Parens Patriae, shame their leaders; see them seized by brutish hands befitting brutish miens such as theirs.Let not their disarray see our fiefs fall to the avaricious hearts of lesser, wayward men." />

Make yourself known and friend to others within the ranks of the Flamines Castus, gain an audience and supplicate yourself before the Rex Sacrarum. " />

    <string id="hkuoXPq0" text="Rare have been the days in my life that royals and kingkillers, emperors and sultans would come to speak to me. It has happened before, my words offered little comfort. Powerful rulers seek always to control how they are viewed, how they will be remembered; and in pursuit of eternity they damn themselves by neglecting the present. Your deeds and influence are those which will be penned in our grand works as a culture; but I pray that you do not forget that you live only in this age." />

You could turn back now, take love and heart in a liminal existence. But should you desire to be known and to be sung of, you must first prove yourself worthy of my ink." />
    <string id="OJz46jAS" text="Do you think me the fool, o hero? I know well your name, and you are known well to the people. That you think you need be inducted to be part of our tales is both insult and strange courtesy; for you are an important player upon our world’s stage. But if you deign to think you need my approval than so be it. I shall see your name illuminated upon fine vellum, and when word of your deeds reaches the ears of others upon the path, I shall see it penned." />
    <string id="fEAYu8Ff" text="I know your tale, there is value in hearing it but perhaps not yet in speaking it. Take no offense, you are worth more to the people than the escapades of a fishwife of Merroc or the rumors of a downtrodden swamp thug upon the Ebor.

    <string id="XnASmGdF" text="Would you now? Bold of you to ask, bolder still to think you have the stones for it. You are an untested soul, your saga perhaps barely begun or as of yet unworthy of an audience. You are far from a Wilund the Bold or an Oca the Conqueror. I will not anoint you upon this path until you have a name worthy of a scrivener’s pen." />
    <string id="1VowoFXC" text="That you, someday, shall age and wither as I have. Your grave will come to claim you, as it claims us all.

    <string id="QJdm8dgE" text="Have you considered that perhaps when our hands and songs can convey only the small glimpses of the liminal upon vellum, that what is forgotten in the faith of the eternal is more beautiful? That it may yet rest, in Heavens or places fouler? That your name, should it rise ever higher, may be cursed or spoken for as long as our texts yet live? What glory you seek in this life may not follow you to the next. But very well, you are anointed upon our pages. May this bring you peace and allow you time to seek comforts more deeply personal." />
    <string id="nhEHrqse" text="I will remember your name for we have shared these words, but I fade with the hours from my autumn into winter; and what comfort you may hold by being known to an Elder Illuminator is a small thing to cherish when compared to being sung in a bard’s song." />
    <string id="FGnpjbvG" text="That you think you need the approval of a humble scrivener to be formally inducted into the Canticles is a courtesy unnecessary but greatly appreciated; for now my own name shall play a role beyond merely a rubricator in the grand tales of this age. " />
    <string id="puCm6PoZ" text="Were you a soul of middling ambitions this could be comfort to you; but were you that, you’d not find yourself so bound within the fate of an era.

    <string id="r7Hmedg3" text="Compete in tournaments, serve a lord well, participate in a war and make yourself the leader of a true clan - not a mere rabble mob.

    <string id="XX7Ob5HY" text="Find victory within a tournament, kidnap a haughty noble, put a bastard’s head to the chopping block, or become known to the folk of Vlandia for good or for ill. Only then will I see fit to have your name illuminated in the margins of our tale." />
    <string id="4qbtiG9m" text="I do not preach, I merely illuminate. I have penned the Canticles since I first arrived on the continent as a child, a war orphan in the homeland who found comfort only in the cold embrace of a cloister. I was a goliard, a true firebrand once; and a scrivener when time demanded it of me." />
    <string id="jtinxrFT" text="I do not preach, stranger. I pen the Canticles, the compounded histories of our myriad people - of our wars, our epics, our tragedies and our sorrows. While young goliards boast in the cities of our kingdom, I am but a scrivener and have resigned myself to a priory where I might best illuminate the tales of the land by my own hand." />
    <string id="V08yiF68" text="Preach? Do not think me some imperial dog quibbling over their penitential! I do not preach, I sing of the Canticles. I tell the tales of our ancestors and our contemporaries, of those worthy of song and those who carry the song ever upon their lips." />
    <string id="eTPHgScM" text="I fought, I killed, I was a legend in the making - as all men would claim to be in hubris. But my hands ached upon a sword hilt; far more than when I gripped a quill. And thus I illuminate, even still in my sunset days." />
    <string id="zQKW5qog" text="It is a humble post, and those who recite the tales by rote are seldom worthy of the annals themselves - but those who pen them are granted the privilege of signing their names, and thus we shall be remembered as those who carried the song. " />
    <string id="JD8uK0Bq" text="Preach, bah! A Vlandian does not preach, they embody the epic and embolden themselves to actions - to pursuits grander than those who came before them!" />
    <string id="Rp3k6Uzy" text="In my youth I would tell you that to be sung of requires violence and glorious deeds; but wiser now I say you need only be patient. Our faith - if one can call it a faith beyond that which we put in our peers - is one of syncretism and patience. We speak of the Heavens, the Otherworld, the Sight, all manner of tenets absorbed from lands we’ve conquered and fought upon." />
    <string id="tcOP12FR" text="Prove your… Perhaps you do not understand the nature of the Canticles? You are a player upon this stage, a character within the tale; all who live are. Whether you are to be tertiary, secondary; villain or protagonist, is a matter of those who pen the page and the nature of your deeds. If you wish to be exalted by history and sung of in the Canticles, you must spread your influence far and wide." />
    <string id="RWyggtYq" text="f you wish to be enshrined within the tales and songs of the Vlandian people, you must embody those who came before you and learn from their deeds. You must then prove your mettle and that you are not a mere follower upon the path, but a being worthy of being sung in the Canticles of the nation. Knights and kings, barons and bandits; all will fade with time if they do not give cause for their memory to be known." />
    <string id="NcpfHNyp" text="All things we accept as truth, though not of importance when compared to the legacy we leave upon this world. If you wish to prove your faith, go forth with an open mind and a patient heart; if you are to be a legend worthy of the Canticles, fate shall provide you the chance. " />
    <string id="Ri01Z2Pe" text="You must be known, for good or for ill; by deeds worthy of remembrance. Vlandia celebrates warfare and the mercenary life for many reasons, but foremost among them for many is that a sellsword is far more memorable than a money lender or a basket weaver. If you wish to prove your place is more worthy of the song, perform bold deeds. " />
    <string id="bWocbYpR" text="If you wish to prove your mettle, you must compete with the deeds of old for the good of our people. Conquer, raid, play at court; make yourself known - live a life both bold and notorious!

    <string id="r9fs17QX" text="In towns, most goods will be produced by local craftsmen. They supply goods such as weapons, clothing, iron, tools and others. More craftsmen will mean more goods in general. Workshops provide more specialized goods and at faster pace. The quality of goods is influenced by the local production quality, while speed of production is influenced by production efficiency." />
    <string id="kx9hK4SA" text="Villages are similar, though their productions are much more limited. The village's production will largely depend on it's workforce. Various productions, such as farm goods, will depend on it's acreage, meaning that having extra workers over what the land needs will be fruitless. Other productions such as ores depend exclusively on workforce numbers, and are not limited by acreage. Village productions can be expanded by village buildings." />
    <string id="kB584OYU" text="Population is limited by the settlement's population limit. This limit relies mostly on the local acreage - more useful land will allow more people to fed. Serfs and slaves compose the workforce and make the bulk of labor, including construction and food production. Slaves are usually better in hard labor such as mining, while serfs are more productive as farmers. State slaves contribute to state projects such as construction projects or worforce policies." />
    <string id="DgUr4orO" text="A quick way of increasing workforce is gathering prisoners and outlaws and turning them into slaves. Keep in mind, slaves are not free, and do not contribute to population growth. Serfs represent the bulk of growth. Increasing population limit and allowing them to grow by themselves is the recommended long term strategy." />
    <string id="L87e0h2a" text="Food production relies on acreage. Each acre of land requires an amount of workforce. If it is met, the acre will produce food. The output depends on acre type - farmlands are the most productive. When town's stocks are filled, the production will be sold to the market. A town only truly runs out of food when the market is empty, as people will buy it off when their own stocks are empty." />
    <string id="UNBcpRLu" text="Villages work exactly the same. They will supply town markets by selling their output and thus generating an income. Increasing workforce through population increase is the main method of increasing general food output. However, if workforce saturation is over 100%, it is recommended to focus on acreage expansion instead, as new laborers will not have land to work on." />

Soon, Llewellyn the Green has found many smithies in his domain, that supplied Battanian archers with two hand swords, creating army of Fian Champions and became first king of the highlands.

She wished to sail south, to plentiful sturgian Vanni woods, but her strict Jarl father denied her permission to do so. To prove she is able to make her own decisions she ventured north and managed to kill ice dragon of Jumne with a throw of a single axe, that cut off all three heads of the mighty beast.

In general, the book integrates moral and physical conduct and provides an important relationship between mental and physical states of health.

    <string id="dUaYvqQu" text="In Banner Kings, religions are attached to cultures and possibly factions. All heroes (lords, notables) and settlements of that group will follow the adequate faith. All religions are defined by a few core aspects, their doctrines, rites, divinities and clergy.\nDoctrines are features of the faith - they may introduce buffs and debuffs, or slightly change the faith's behavior.\nClergy are the representatives of the faith. They function as notables in settlements. Each faith has a different hierarchy of clergy, with different titles and spawning at different types of settlements. The clergy are how heroes may interact with the faith\nThrough them you may perform rites, which will award you with piety, as well as receive blessings from the divinities." />
    <string id="AGbBGrX8" text="In Banner Kings, settlement management is several layers more in depth than vanilla. Settlements have many new interconnected factors such as Mercantilism, Militarism, Stability, Autonomy, and others, making settlement management way more intricate than choosing a new town project every few weeks or so. They also have several new policies (multi choice options) and decisions (true/false options) that it's owner may manage.\nYou can check all this information in Demesne Management tab in your settlements - all of the fields have tooltips with further explanations." />
    <string id="c0ndZFek" text="Food is extensively reworked. Food in settlements is now produced and consumed in the hundreds by the day - every single person in the population eats, in a similar rate to your soldiers. Food in settlements is now dictated by settlement acreage and it's workforce. The settlement needs acres ready to work and people - serfs and slaves - to work on them. Settlements will no longer starve with markets full of food - the population will buy off the market stocks when production does not meed demand, meaning true starvating will only start when markets are completely out of food. Food stocks are much higher, based on population. Excess food in stocks will rot. If the limit is reached, the population sells food items to the market instead of the food simply disappearing. Food can be manually dumped into the settlement by stocking the Stack with food - it will only be consumed when the normal reserves are very low." />
    <string id="NsabZ6iw" text="In Banner Kings, Educations are now a big part of heroes' personal lives. Heroes may learn languages, read books and adopt lifestyles. Languages may be taught to you by someone fluent in it.\nBooks are sold by the few book sellers in the continent. Each book is written in a different language - you can not read any book at will.\nLifestyles present a new way to specialize in a specific way of living. Lifestyles are composed by 2 skills, and advance slowly through time. At some point, you need to reach a skill threshold to keep advancing. Advancement is rewarded with unique, powerful perks each lifestyle contains. In addition to these, lifestyles have passive effects - both a negative and positive one, which respectively punish and reward you for playing as the lifestyle is intended to be played." />
    <string id="SPYNasOF" text="Titles are also composed of laws, duties and rights, that together form the contract. All titles in the same hierarchy have the same contract. All titles have Succession, Inheritance, Government and Gender laws. Succession describes how the faction leadership is inherited, while Inheritance describes the clans' leadership inheritance. Government has various passive effects on settlements as well as dictate what kingdom policies are possible, and sometimes restricts the other laws. Gender law describes the preference for a certain gender in terms of granting knighthood, faction succession and clan inheritance." />
    <string id="19hMJEJy" text="Titles are also composed of laws, duties and rights, that together form the contract. All titles in the same hierarchy have the same contract. Duties and Rights are fulfilled between vassal and suzerain. Your suzerain is the title holder of the title directly above your highest title. Say you have a dukedom title - in the hierarchy, the dukedom is under a kingdom. The kingdom title holder will be your suzerain, and you their vassal. Vassals fulfill Duties such as paying taxes, or participating in armies (the player is coerced to participate, with renown penalties). Suzerains fulfill rights such as granting titles or financial aids in certain circunstances." />
    <string id="hdCe0ntY" text="In Banner Kings, clans have a council. Councils are composed by 5 roles - marshal, steward, chancellor, spymaster and religious advisor.\nThese roles may be performed by notables or vassals, and each of them requires a specific skillset. Therefore, different candidates will have different competences at each role.\nCouncils may also be Royal Councils. These are the councils of the faction leading clans. These councils have extra positions and characteristics. The new positions are dynamic and depend on various factors such as kingdom culture and government form. Lastly, Royal Councils' 5 main roles may only be filled by lords, the king's vassals, and not by lowly notables." />
    <string id="00LCPzVE" text="In Banner Kings, innovations in technology and society happen over time. These may alter several aspects - mainly in settlements - such as agricultural output or general production efficiency.\nEach culture has a set of innovations that advances independently from others. They also have a Fascination - an innovation that develops faster.\nInnovations are developed with research points. These are generated by settlements, mainly settlements' noble population. The more settlements a culture has, the faster it advances." />
    <string id="ipu2SLhu" text="In Banner Kings, smithing is significantly extended with the possibility of crafting bardings, shields, ammunitions and armor pieces. Unlike weapon crafting, these have a botching chance, based on the piece's difficulty compared to your smithing skill. When botched, you get xp, but no item.\nIn addition, smithing is made harder. Everything costs more stamina to build. Every point of stamina spent correlates to time spent in the map - spending all your stamina will make you wait several hours in the settlement, working on your smithing. These hours are also paid hours, because the smithy is not yours. Essentialy, Banner Kings aims to fix smithing as a massive exploit in the game, while extending it's uses." />

The hierarchy stablishes suzerain-vassal relationships between the title holders. Holding a title has several impacts, mainly affecting your Vassal Limit and Demesne Limit, that limit your number of vassal clans &amp; knights, and your limit of fiefs, respectively. Every faction at game start has a kingdom-level title that represents them. This title is passed on to successive leaders of the faction, in different forms, depending on the title's Succession law." />

Pérkenweyd, or 'tree lore', understands that the Great Oak is the source of life and root for the world of mankind. Besides the physical world, a dualistic view of Underworld and the Sacred Canopy separates what is good and bad, righteous and malicious. The Gods perch on the Sacred Canopy, atop the Great Oak, from where they defend and guide the children of the forest, that is, those that adhere to the faith. The children believe that spirits roam this world, and in the grains of oaks they chronicle all that which they witness. Experienced elders claim, however, that also the future may be known through the spirits, and as such are known to delve into divination practices. Moreover, believers argue that being a child of the forest is not a decision one takes, but is, instead, their ancestry. As such, a child of the forest must uphold the Gods, family and ancestry above all else." />
