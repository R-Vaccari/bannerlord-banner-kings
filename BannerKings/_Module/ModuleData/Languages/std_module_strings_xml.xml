Emperors were deified, made to stand alongside their own gods as peers. During the waning generations of the united empire many would proclaim themselves god-emperor, or other divinely appointed titles; the rite of the divus can only transubstantiate an emperor upon their death.

Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys. He is accompanied by Astaronia, his bride who represents that which must be protected by the machinations of imperial might; and by his daughter Mesnona who was born from the ego of Iovis and who grants insight to mortal petitioners." />

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Though traditionalists will note the Cant is but a deviation of the illuminated manuscripts and oral tales of the pre-Calradic Vlandian culture, modern adherents claim the Cant to be the methodology of rebels, wanderers, rascals, and conquerors. Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller. As such the works depicted therein are often viewed as satire or crude witticisms, but few cloisters will deny their worth.

Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands.

Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders." />
    <string id="hvuqVf2m" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands. Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling." />
    <string id="spy2ujFu" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />
    <string id="itzfxuQ9" text="Be mindful also of the company you keep, for though all among the Aserai are as brothers - and even the Jawwal and Bedouin are as our cousins; those beyond our blood lineage may not understand your purpose. They may lead you from the path, away from the Code; away from the good of the Aserai. But perhaps I speak this in fear - the long toll of the Empire upon our culture." />
    <string id="hmkcSU3i" text="To not seek vengeance against those who have attacked your holdings, besieged your homes, murdered your people - is a greater shame. No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />
    <string id="8b9Qad8j" text="When you are called by your brothers, you must come to them; you must serve beside them, you must never fail them if it is in your power. Know also that keeping the company of those outside the Code of Asera will surely corrupt you - you are your brother’s keeper, and they in turn yours. For good or for ill." />
    <string id="NiDTPPz2" text="Know that I tolerate your presence on behalf of my blooded siblings in the Banu, and though you may desire to coax me with honeyed words or threats of coercion - know also that I am beyond your grasp. I am the Murshid of [Placename], and my word guides the Sultanate by the reading of the Code of Asera. Speak truthfully and with no deceit, lest I denounce your lineage and see them flayed to the last." />
    <string id="gw31Xmny" text="Peace be upon you, outlander. May you walk with the safety of Asera while you dwell in the company of his sons - and while you walk the lands where his Code is law. I am an Imam of the Aserai, and I bid you hospitality expecting it fully in kind. Is there something I may do for our mutual good?" />
    <string id="fvJt4aTX" text="Peace be to you, outlander. You do not carry yourself as a Son of Asera, so I shall forgive your ignorance - provided you come here in search of wisdom. I am an Akhund, a scholar of the Code of Asera, the guiding truth of the southlands. If you come here with a clouded heart, there is little I can offer you." />

    <string id="ws5gbCMX" text="Mashaera, blood of my blood. It is good to see you are alive and that you are in good health; for the world is rife with conflict beyond our brotherhood and little is to be held as certain.

    <string id="yMvqUQpw" text="Peace be upon you, my kin. Have you come to study the Code of Asera? I shall grant you what wisdom I have gleaned in my long hours of study, but as your brother I must tell you that I find myself more ignorant the more I realize the breadth of what there is still yet to learn." />

    <string id="byHGTYHh" text="Alas, you are no Son of Asera and thus you could never truly follow the Code of Asera. Not in any way that I could fathom. There may be precedent for one beyond our blood to successfully follow the code, but for this you should seek out an Akhund; a scholar of the faith." />
    <string id="A06Nfw6t" text="You think that it would go unnoticed how the folk here cringe at your visage? How your name is whispered with scornful lips? Are they mislead about you? Perhaps, perhaps. We shall see." />
    <string id="CfdXEpue" text="You are known to me and to this village; not as a savior or as a good soul, but as one of us. You are humble, perhaps because you lack the boldness to pursue being charitable - or perhaps just the means. I do not know, and I do not judge." />
    <string id="mg8AZu6P" text="I wish you well in such pursuits, and that you live a life of peace wherever this path may take you." />
    <string id="ZPEn4EDa" text="If you wish to be made a follower of the Code of Asera, you must treat these people as you would a sibling - you must cherish them, exalt them, protect them and educate them. Show them your better nature and I shall perform upon you our rites of induction." />

    <string id="uz70E5mx" text="I offer my sage counsel to the kin of the Banu, to guide them upon the paths walked by Asera of old. I grant them the means of pilgrimage - for only when one knows the deepest wisdom and learned truths of the Code of Asera may they truly strive for self-improvement." />
    <string id="EofwaHJQ" text="I preach the glory of Asera, our progenitor of legend. I preach lessons learned from the treasury of wisdom he has granted us as his children. I preach that the Aserai shall reign in happiness and in sorrow, so long as we remain as brothers within the Banu confederacies." />
    <string id="3sxQsTy7" text="I preach that which is hidden in poetics of Nahasi dialects and in the riddles of converts stolen away by Darshi slavers in generations past. I seek to unravel the mysteries of all that Asera asked of his sons - to truly understand charity, devotion, and the cost of peace even in these times of eschatological turmoil." />
    <string id="cDU19QLK" text="I preach the Code of Asera, the backbone of our society, the soul of our nation. For we are all Sons of Asera in these lands, and it is through the patriarch’s example that we go forth in honor and bring glory to his legacy." />
    <string id="QfQjwGLe" text="I ensure they remember that they are as siblings to the lowliest beggar or the most jackal-thirsting Jawwal marauder; that they must always express love towards that which is good and revile the roguery that leads the soul towards wicked deeds." />
    <string id="nRiRiRA6" text="I preach that our future shall be as luminous as the sun and as enduring as the Nahasa, so long as we remain united, so long as we are charitable, so long as we welcome even the Jawwal to embrace the Code as their own guiding path in life!" />
    <string id="EYkmpAva" text="I preach that we should question the nature of goodness and of wisdom; for a good man would not claim to be wise, and a wise man not claim to be good." />
    <string id="B9XBmvyy" text="We are those who adhere to tradition but know also the struggle to move beyond the belligerence of the past - we are no Jawwal, after all." />
    <string id="cWg41iew" text="You come before me, like a wriggling eel slithering to a master archer and asking to learn to wield the bow. I shall speak plainly to you, for my time is short and my station vaunted. When you see that which is evil, you must change it by whatever force you can - if not your hands, then your heart, if not your heart, then your words." />
    <string id="gToavgYL" text="A common question among the devout and misguided alike; for how can one truly be assured they walk the righteous path? We know not until the end comes and we are weighed against the deeds of our progenitor; but I shall guide you with what wisdom I can." />
    <string id="DXwkpjeQ" text="Consider your actions and why it is you perform them. If you are of influence, do you wield this power for the good of your siblings or do you take it for your own aggrandizement? When your people starve, do you feast? Do you turn to the sword? Is blood spilled for bread gained a worthy trade?" />
    <string id="u0iwuK22" text="It does my heart kindly to hear you wish to prove your faith. We live in an age of lip service by most - though I hold no blame to the common man for this; they show their adherence and their faith in their daily labors. If you wish to prove your faith and your adherence to doctrine, you must be a soul who knows peace and who adheres to hierarchy." />
    <string id="duyNvFEg" text="Seek to improve the lives of even the least of your people and you shall make kings of them all; and know that should you find yourself poorer and your servants richer that you are a better sibling than many of your blood.

    <string id="4zEWWVpe" text="Foremost in my viewing, as a man of the cities of our lands; is the act of almsgiving. We are as keepers to our brothers, to our sisters and siblings; and only a cruel soul would let the blood of their blood starve.You are only as pure as the lowest among us, and thus you purify yourself of sin when you seek to uplift the whole of the Aserai." />
    <string id="kM7O8NK3" text="If you seek to prove your faith, you must internalize the Code of Asera - you must learn and accept that you are but one of his Sons - and you must seek to bring forth a better world for your children to inherit. Prove your faith by making that world. Time will tell if the image in your mind is truly an embodiment of the Code’s doctrines or merely self-indulgence." />

Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />

It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos.

If you wish to remain in the good graces of the Darusosian Martyrdom, you should not seek to usurp the whims of the imperial throne.

    <string id="GF8kvMfn" text="Oh, thou’rt of a kind to think they may posture before the Rex Sacrarum? Set thine eyes upon my personage with a coy and feigned humility? For what foul purpose doth thou think this shall profit them? To come before me so discourteously, as if I were some mere member of the lay flamines meant to play scenes of betrayal like some fool goliard of the upstart borderland principalities?

If you are friend, I bid you allow me offer you succor and comfort; if you are yet to accept the Martyr into your heart, pray allow me to elucidate.You shall know no regret save for time spent in ignorance of a beatific truth." />
    <string id="QhEHgXaL" text="Mine is the voice that speaks for the Martyr’s will, alas only in mournful penitentials. I wear this mantle by my own volition, for overlong have there been aspiring tyrants who sought to further usurp his mandates by way of vile machinations. Seldom am I to preach, for mine is the role to contemplate the mysteries of creation as glanced by Darusos as he was made eternal through the rites of divus.Fret not, for though I hold all the myriad gods of our Empire - both those liberated from savage cultures and those brought with us from our ancestral birthplace - I am that which holds the Martyr above all others." />
    <string id="oZddNoSP" text="I preach the doctrines of Darusos, our Emperor betrayed in his youth by the vile treachery of his generals. A child, wise beyond his years and graced with the beatific sight of Heaven; he sought to see the Empire reign as a place of order where patrician and plebeian alike need not suffer fear. He would see us fed, watered, and granted the joys that we are due - and if not for the craven workings of sellswords and tyrant upstarts, he would have reigned one thousand years." />
    <string id="fPT4Barn" text="Lo, for I preach the tragedy of the Martyr Darusos, an Emperor betrayed in his youth by the cruel ambitions of his generals. He was targeted, for even the most oathbound man can be made a craven sellsword when they gaze upon the throne of an Empire. Darusos was a goodly sort, he wept for the Palaics and the Vakken, he wrote an elegy for the Perassic League in their fading days. He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men. It was for this that Darusos was crucified upon a sacred fig tree and set ablaze - all his aspirations but kindling… Take heart, for this is the sermon of a Martyr - not merely one of a man." />
    <string id="dh0cpao4" text="‘Tis my desire to spread the denied transpositions of the Martyr to the licentious masses of our age. To absolve our Empire the foul stains of hubristic usurpers, and to see seized with thine own hands a fate where the line betwixt Darusos to Arenicos, and beyond to Rhagaea Pethros and Ira Pethros may undergo the rite of divus before tragedy may befall them. I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />
    <string id="EkCUxcN4" text="But no. Betrayed by his generals, spat upon by the Senate, and mocked by his honor guard - Darusos was crucified to a sacred fig tree and burnt to cinders. His great works and scribed doctrines set ablaze with him. As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
    <string id="b9bfZtiZ" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />
    <string id="xcCHnLYz" text="Ahh, ‘tis wisdom and arrogance that thou shalt seek the Rex Sacrarum for elucidation. What is thine intent, to seek one wise beyond the ken of an age and bid they preach the rote doctrine of the lay flamines? Thoust have no need to be coy, nor ignorant, nor false. I shall speak and do so with courtesy - for this is what the Martyr would have of me. Perilous is the hour and heretics run rife through our Empire.Scourge those who cling to the Augeo Sophica or the Parens Patriae, shame their leaders; see them seized by brutish hands befitting brutish miens such as theirs.Let not their disarray see our fiefs fall to the avaricious hearts of lesser, wayward men." />

Make yourself known and friend to others within the ranks of the Flamines Castus, gain an audience and supplicate yourself before the Rex Sacrarum. " />

    <string id="L87e0h2a" text="Food production relies on acreage. Each acre of land requires an amount of workforce. If it is met, the acre will produce food. The output depends on acre type - farmlands are the most productive. When town's stocks are filled, the production will be sold to the market.

Soon, Llewellyn the Green has found many smithies in his domain, that supplied Battanian archers with two hand swords, creating army of Fian Champions and became first king of the highlands.

To prove she is able to make her own decisions she ventured north and managed to kill ice dragon of Jumne with a throw of a single axe, that cut off all three heads of the mighty beast.

In general, the book integrates moral and physical conduct and provides an important relationship between mental and physical states of health.

The shadows of dawn are long and cold. ut there was one farmer, some say he was a Massa, others that he was the son of a Nord. Most of us count him as a snake god, but that is another tale.

So Mordus watched Orm yoke a fine ox and plough slowly south towards him. And he drank. The sun was setting over the western sea. He drank so much that he didn’t see the ox was ploughing away the mountainside, by the time the ox came close, Mordus was asleep. And so Oca picked up the pace as night fell and charged right at the sleeping Mordus and cut him to pieces. In the morning light, Orm was horrified. There stood Oca, a giant ox, drinking wine from Mordus’ corpse. It had spilled into the furrow made the day before. Orm shouted at Oca: “I asked you to plough away the body of Mordus but here you are drinking up my wine.”, to which the go replied: “No. This is the wine thou hast promised me. But thou gavest it to Mordus. Now I plough no more. Every summer I will come back and drink this wine, and thou shalt have nothing more from the gods. Instead, beest happy with what thou havest.
