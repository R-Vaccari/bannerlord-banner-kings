		        text="In Banner Kings, settlement management is several layers more in depth than vanilla. Settlemetns have many new interconnected factors such as Mercantilism, Militarism, Stability, Autonomy, and others, making settlement management way more intricate than choosing a new town project every few weeks or so. They also have several new policies (multi choice options) and decisions (true/false options) that it's owner may manage. You can check all this information in Demesne Management tab in your settlements - all of the fields have tooltips with further explanations." />

		<string id="ALDs4Tpn"
		        text="Banner Kings introduces a new Attribute - Wisdom - as well as 3 new skills: Scholarship, Lordship and Theology. These new skills provide new ways to acquire experience and level up. On top of that, skill modifiers are changed. For starters, the minimum experience gain is now 5% rather than 0%. This means that the vanilla game would block you from learning skills past a certain past - this is not the case anymore. You can always keep learning, albeit very slowly." />

		<string id="v779BscB"
		        text="Among the many new stats tracking heroes and settlements are the Demesne Limit and Vassal Limit features. These act as soft limits respectively for fief ownership and vassal clans / knights under you. The limits set the point of diminishing returns. Going over it too much will eventually lead to negative returns. Effectively, Demesne Limit makes you incapable to hold an indeterminate amount of fiefs - you will only be able to efficiently manage a few - while vassal limit makes oversized kingdoms increasingly unviable to manage. The vanilla game sets no limit to how much land or people you control - those limits severely restrict these abilities." />

		<string id="0wyLYy4O"
		        text="In Banner Kings, AI lords now have much more dynamic financial lives. AI clans will buy caravans and workshops in similar manner to player. The same costs, incomes and restrictions apply.\nOver time, this means AI clans will build several sources of income, allowing them to grow bigger and stronger, or have reserves then losing their settlements.\nAnother major change is that AI will now save money during peace time. Lords will roam the world with small parties - enough to not get consistently captured by bandits - saving their reserves for war time. As a consequence of that, settlements train their volunteers - when war time comes, armies will be immediatly drafted and made mostly of quality troops instead of recruits.\nLastly, notables will now financially aid the clans they are supporters of. This creates a flow of currency from notables to lords, making them a more active part of wartimes." />

		<string id="xrP4hW4m" text="Game Balance - Settlement Food" />
		<string id="fgcGuVJa"
		        text="Food is extensively reworked. Food in settlemetns is now produced and consumed in the hundreds by the day - every single person in the population eats, in a similar rate to your soldiers. Food in settlements is now dictated by settlement acreage and it's workforce. The settlement needs acres ready to work and people - serfs and slaves - to work on them. Settlements will no longer starve with markets full of food - the population will buy off the market stocks when production does not meed demand, meaning true starvating will only start when markets are completely out of food. Food stocks are much higher, based on population. Excess food in stocks will rot. If the limit is reached, the population sells food items to the market instead of the food simply disappearing. Food can be manually dumped into the settlement by stocking the Stack with food - it will only be consumed when the normal reserves are very low." />
		<string id="2oJQ4Snn" text="Economy" />
		<string id="audvSv7u"
		        text="In Banner Kings, the economy landscape is quite different.\nDemand is generated by population in settlements, and therefore much more dynamic than before as population classes fluctuate, and each class has different demands.\nTrade goods have modifiers such as 'fine', 'masterwork' or 'crude', what opens new possibilities in terms of profit.\nManufactured items are on average quite more expensive, making workshops and caravans significantly more profitable.\nWorkshops owners now pay taxes to the settlement owner.\nSettlement market gold no longer resets on a daily basis - settlements can accumulate large amounts of gold, or go bankrupt, hence need some time to recover." />
		<string id="WwRKELwd" text="Learn about the various improvements over the economy system." />
		<string id="6fErfVWf"
		        text="Villages produce income by selling their production outputs. Villages will now produce based on population workforce, as well as available acreage, if fitting. For example, agricultural productions are limited by the amount of acres available and their production capacity - even if you have extra workers, the fields can only produce so much.\nAs a result, villages can produce much more income than before. This is extra relevant for Knighthood, which you can read more about in the articles below." />

		<string id="QBywqQOA"
		        text="In Banner Kings, legal titles exist in what is called Demesne (domain) Hierarchy. Titles may be landed or not. Landed titles are directly attached to a fief - lordships are village titles, baronies are castle titles, counties are town titles. Above these are unlanded titles, such as dukedoms and kingdoms. The hierarchy stablishes suzerain-vassal relationships between the title holders. Holding a title has several impacts, mainly affecting your Vassal Limit and Demesne Limit, that limit your number of vassal clans &amp; knights, and your limit of fiefs, respectively. Every faction at game start has a kingdom-level title that represents them. This title is passed on to successive leaders of the faction, in different forms, depending on the title's Succession law." />

Once knighted, they can raise a party. It also requires a lordship title, who the knight will receive and use it's income to pay their own party - you only pay for those led by your family members. Knights can eventualy grow as lords and found their own clan. Knights are used by the AI, meaning many new lords are travelling on the map, and eventually many new clans sprout.

Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands.
